# Welcome to the project tester for BLG561E

Here you can access sample test data and have a look at the final (as much as possible ATM) test script.

This data and the code will give you an idea regarding the evaluation of your code and the In/Out for your detector. Please follow the comments inside "test.py" for more information.

Cheers
